This repository contains OSM styles in SLD & QML formats; both were generated in QGIS 3.

The style has been inspired by Ordnance Survey Map, "Lanarkshire VII.12 (Old Monkland)Survey date: 1858   Publication date: 1860". See it on the National Library of Scotland page (https://maps.nls.uk/view/74955769).
